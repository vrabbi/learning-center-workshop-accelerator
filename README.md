# Tanzu Application Platform - Learning Center Workshop Accelerator
This repo contains an accelerator for scaffolding a workshop.  
Not all functionality is exposed via the accelerator, as that would be too difficult of a form to get started with for many users, however the key functionality has been exposed.

1. Authentication configuration for the training portal
2. Additional RBAC for sessions
3. Additional k8s resources for sessions
4. Changing the base image for the workshop
5. Custom Dashboard Additions

If any of the above (or other features i have not mentioned) seem to you they should be added, please let me know
